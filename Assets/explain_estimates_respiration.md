To estimate the volume of air breathed during an exercise session, we use minute ventilation, which is the amount of air a person breathes in one minute.

$$
\text{Minute Ventilation (VE)} = \text{Tidal Volume (TV)} \times \text{Respiratory Rate (RR)}
$$

Where:
- Tidal Volume (TV) is the amount of air inhaled or exhaled in a single breath (mL).
- Respiratory Rate (RR) is the number of breaths taken per minute.
- 

**Tidal Volume (TV):**
   For a healthy, athletic male, the tidal volume at rest is typically around 500 mL. A reasonable estimate for an athletic individual during moderate to intense exercise might be around 1,000 mL per breath.

**Respiratory Rate (RR):**
   The respiratory rate can vary significantly during exercise. A common estimate for an average exercise intensity is around 30 breaths per minute for an athletic individual.

E.g.: example exercise session (1 hour):
   * 1 hour duration = 60 mins
   * tidal volume: 1000  mL/breath
   * respiration rate: 30 breaths/min


1. **Calculate Minute Ventilation (VE):**

   $
   \text{VE} = \text{TV} \times \text{RR}
   $

   $
   1000 \text{ mL/breath} \times 30 \text{ breaths/min} = 30,000 \text{ mL/min}
   $
   
2. **Calculate the total volume of air breathed during the exercise session:**

   $
   \text{Total Volume} = \text{VE} \times \text{Duration}
   $

   $
   30,000 \text{ mL/min} \times 60 \text{ min} \approx 1,800,000 \text{ mL}
   $

The estimated volume of respiration during this example exercise session is approximately:

### **1800 liters**.
