To estimate the volume of blood pumped during exercise, we can use the concept of cardiac output, which is the amount of blood the heart pumps per minute. Cardiac output can be estimated using the formula:

$ \text{Cardiac Output (CO)} = \text{Heart Rate (HR)} \times \text{Stroke Volume (SV)} $

Where:
- Heart Rate (HR) is in beats per minute (bpm).
- Stroke Volume (SV) is the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat, typically measured in milliliters (mL).

For a healthy, athletic male, the stroke volume can vary, but a common estimate is around 70 mL per beat at rest, and it can increase during exercise. For an athletic individual, we might estimate a stroke volume of around 100 mL per beat during exercise.

1. **Convert the heart rate to beats per minute:**
   $
   \text{HR} = 134.3 \text{ bpm}
   $

2. **Estimate the stroke volume:**
   $
   \text{SV} = 100 \text{ mL/beat}
   $

3. **Calculate the cardiac output:**
   $
   \text{CO} = \text{HR} \times \text{SV} = 134.3 \text{ bpm} \times 100 \text{ mL/beat} = 13430 \text{ mL/min}
   $

4. **Convert the exercise duration from seconds to minutes:**
   $
   \text{Duration} = \frac{5141 \text{ seconds}}{60} \approx 85.68 \text{ minutes}
   $

5. **Calculate the total volume of blood pumped during the exercise session:**
   $
   \text{Total Volume} = \text{CO} \times \text{Duration} = 13430 \text{ mL/min} \times 85.68 \text{ min} \approx 1,150,000 \text{ mL}
   $

6. **Convert milliliters to liters:**
   $
   \text{Total Volume in Liters} = \frac{1,150,000 \text{ mL}}{1000} \approx 1150 \text{ liters}
   $

Thus, the estimated volume of blood pumped during the exercise session is approximately **1150 liters**. 

(Note: This is a theoretical calculation and actual values can vary based on individual physiology and exercise intensity.)
