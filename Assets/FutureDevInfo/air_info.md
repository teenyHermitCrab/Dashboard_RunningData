To estimate the volume of air breathed during an exercise session, we can use the concept of minute ventilation, which is the amount of air a person breathes in one minute. Minute ventilation can be calculated using the formula:

$ \text{Minute Ventilation (VE)} = \text{Tidal Volume (TV)} \times \text{Respiratory Rate (RR)} $

Where:
- Tidal Volume (TV) is the amount of air inhaled or exhaled in a single breath, typically measured in milliliters (mL).
- Respiratory Rate (RR) is the number of breaths taken per minute.

### Estimating Values

1. **Tidal Volume (TV):**
   For a healthy, athletic male, the tidal volume at rest is typically around 500 mL. During exercise, this can increase. A reasonable estimate for an athletic individual during moderate to intense exercise might be around 1,000 mL (1 L) per breath.

2. **Respiratory Rate (RR):**
   The respiratory rate can vary significantly during exercise. A common estimate for an average exercise intensity is around 30 breaths per minute for an athletic individual.

### Calculation Steps

1. **Calculate Minute Ventilation (VE):**
   $
   \text{VE} = \text{TV} \times \text{RR} = 1000 \text{ mL/breath} \times 30 \text{ breaths/min} = 30,000 \text{ mL/min}
   $

2. **Convert the exercise duration from seconds to minutes:**
   $
   \text{Duration} = \frac{5141 \text{ seconds}}{60} \approx 85.68 \text{ minutes}
   $

3. **Calculate the total volume of air breathed during the exercise session:**
   $
   \text{Total Volume} = \text{VE} \times \text{Duration} = 30,000 \text{ mL/min} \times 85.68 \text{ min} \approx 2,570,400 \text{ mL}
   $

4. **Convert milliliters to liters:**
   $
   \text{Total Volume in Liters} = \frac{2,570,400 \text{ mL}}{1000} \approx 2570.4 \text{ liters}
   $

### Conclusion

The estimated volume of air breathed during the exercise session is approximately **2570.4 liters**. 

(Note: This is a theoretical calculation, and actual values can vary based on individual physiology, exercise intensity, and environmental factors.)
