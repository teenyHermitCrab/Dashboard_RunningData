To estimate the volume of blood pumped during exercise, we use cardiac output, which is the amount of blood the heart pumps per minute.

$$
\text{Cardiac Output (CO)} = \text{Heart Rate (HR)} \times \text{Stroke Volume (SV)}
$$

Where:
- Heart Rate (HR) is in beats per minute (bpm).
- Stroke Volume (SV) is the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat, typically measured in milliliters (mL).

For a healthy, athletic male, the stroke volume can vary, but a common estimate is around 70 mL per beat at rest, and it can increase during exercise. For an athletic individual, we might estimate a stroke volume of around **100 mL** per beat during exercise.

E.g.: example exercise session (1 hour):
   * 1 hour duration = 60 minutes
   * average heartrate = 134.3  (from activity file)
   * stroke volume = 100   (estimate of moderate effort)


1. **Calculate cardiac output:**
   
   $
   \text{CO} = \text{HR} \times \text{SV}
   $
   
   $
   134.3 \text{ bpm} \times 100 \text{ mL/beat} = 13430 \text{ mL/min}
   $


2. **Calculate total volume of blood pumped during the exercise session:**

   $
   \text{Total Volume} = \text{CO} \times \text{Duration}
   $

   $
   805,800 \text{ mL} = 13430 \text{ mL/min} \times 60.0 \text{ min}
   $



The estimated volume of blood pumped during this exercise session is approximately: 
### **806 liters**.
